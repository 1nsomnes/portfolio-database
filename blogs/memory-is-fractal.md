# Memory is Fractal
Recently I opened my journal from two years ago and started paging through my meticulously and regularly written entries. As I reread, it reinvigorated a feeling of malaise towards our relationship with memory. How is it possible that the person I was ten, five, or two years ago is the same person that I am today? That is, how does this constant stream of memory give way to a much more complicated and constantly evolving being? While I am far from having a conclusive answer, I think there is an interesting and satisfying connection between a concept in mathematics called fractals and memory. 

## Fractals
Fractals, by definition, are,

> infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales

Fractals do not have a rigorous mathematical definition and there are popular examples everywhere such as, coast lines or Pascal's triangle.

But they all have this property where as you zoom in there is more and more detail with similar patterns. Another example which is less commonly attributed to fractals is a stochastic process called [Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion). I will not be precisely defining Brownian motion for the purposes of this blog but it can be understood by the following rules:

1. As time moves forward, the process moves up or down in a way that is completely unpredictable from one moment to the next.
2. The movement is continuous, so the path never "teleports" or skips from one value to another without passing through everything in between.
3. There is an increment for every time step with increments proportional to the size of that time step. For example at time t = 1, you can step 0.01 to t = 0.01, 0.1 to t = 1.1, and 1 to t = 2 for every possible step. As you zoom, in you will perceive smaller and smaller step sizes that were not apparent before (this is what makes it fractal).  
4. The path is extremely jagged because it is nowhere smooth, meaning you can never find a straight line segment no matter how much you zoom in.
5. This jaggedness is a sign of fractality, where the path looks statistically similar whether you are looking at a minute of data or a millisecond of data.

## Connecting the two

So, how does this connect to memory. I argue that this happens in a similar way that Brownian Motion works. From moment to moment we change, even from minute to minute or second to second. Although these small time steps have relatively small changes, it is change all the same. And over time these changes compound to create larger change across larger time steps. In this way we see that across all time scales we are changed in the same way that Brownian motion is changed; leading to the fractality of memory. Although it may seem shocking that we are transformed it makes sense as these little changes build on top of each other.

Honestly, I am not sure that this realization is useful in anyway. Especially considering we are exchanging a nebulous reflection on the psychology of memory for another equally nebulous concept in mathematics. While Brownian motion is a well-defined stochastic process it does not change the fact that its results are astonishing. In the end, maybe we just have to accept that there is no simple answer and ceaselessly trying to explain something that is perplexing even while it is well-defined leads to nothing. Who knows!
