# Memory is Fractal
Recently I opened my journal from two years ago and started paging through my meticulously and regularly written entries. As I reread, it reinvigorated a feeling of malaise towards our relationship with memory. How is it possible that the person I was ten, five, or one year ago is the same person as today? That is, how does this constant stream of memory give way to a much more complicated and constantly evolving being? While I am far from having a conclusive answer, I think there is an interesting and satisfying connection between a concept in mathematics called fractals and memory. 

## Fractals
Fractals, by definition, are

> infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales

One popular example of a fractal is called Brownian Motion. 

## Connecting the two


## Conclusion
Fractality is not only apparent in memory, there are a lot of surprising analogies across a vast number of topics. But this one proved particularly fascinating.
