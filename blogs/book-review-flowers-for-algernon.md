## Before You Read (No Spoilers)

Daniel Keyes's _Flowers for Algernon_ is a sci-fi novel following Charlie Gordon, a 32-year-old man with a low IQ who undergoes an experimental, temporary surgery to increase his intelligence. Told through his personal journal entries, the story explores his rapid intellectual growth, the emotional complexities of his changing relationships, and the ethical implications of science.

### The Good
- Creative, unique, and fun writing style 
- Deeply philosophical questions about love, intelligence, humanity, etc... from a new perspective
### The Bad
- Nothing, I think this book was executed excellently

## After You Read (Spoilers)

### Thoughts
This book was absolutely amazing in my eyes. 

Charlie Gordon, who undergoes surgery to increase intelligence, is challenged by the implications of his new found intelligence. As he becomes smarter, he quickly surpasses the capabilities of his work friends, teachers, and doctors. But when he's at his smartest he discovers that this intelligence is only temporary and soon enough he will return to his original intelligence, if not worse.

Gordon is a startling but poignant reminder of how short our lives really are. While Gordon's growth and decay operate on an expedited time frame, all of us are on Gordon's journey. His moments of desperation to keep his intelligence are scarily familiar to our shared destinies. It reminds me that no matter how long I have, one day I too will try to claw back the days when I was more capable. For me, it's important that I apply myself as much as reasonably possible before the opportunity passes. 

His relationship with Alice is one of the most tragic yet beautiful relationships I have ever read in a book. His struggle to emotionally understand her and his feelings for her only to eventually break that barrier was deeply satisfying. However, their dreaded acceptance that they would lose eachother forever was devestating. It shows the beauties and complexities of love in a way I've never seen before. Take advantage of the moments you have with the people you love because you may not have them forever.

Last but not least, the book deals with the idea of intellectual disability very well. As he becomes smarter he discovers the consequences of intelligence. He becomes aware that he was always made fun of rather than made fun with. He becomes aware that he was abused and neglected by his own family. He becomes aware that he didn't know anything at all. And finally, he becomes aware that becoming super smart creates an equally sized social gap as that of being dumb. Each of these ideas could be made into their own book but Keyes navigates them excellently, providing just enough to make you think. It makes me realize the importance of communication, that being able to put yourself in other shoes is highly important to being able to talk to them. And it reminds me of the humanity within intellectual disabilities.

This book does an exceptional job of bringing questions about humanity, love, and intelligence to an entirely new light. And due to the nature of Gordon's operation, we get to experience all stages of intelligence. I highly recommend this book to all readers! 

P.S. please if you get a chanse put some flowrs on Algernons grave in the bak yard.
