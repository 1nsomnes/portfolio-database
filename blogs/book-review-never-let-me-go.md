# Never Let Me Go Book Review 

**Completed:** 01/01/2026

**Rating:** 3/5 

## Before You Read (No Spoilers)

Kazuo Ishiguro's _Never Let Me Go_ is a dystopinian sci-fi novel following Kathy B. who looks back on her days at the secluded Hailsham boarding school. The narrative captures a sense of quiet tragedy—the feeling of a childhood that was idyllic on the surface but underscored by a growing unease about the future. 

Despite _Never Let Me Go's_ critical acclaim I don't think it is an absolute must read. That being said, you will not regret reading this book, especially considering it's on the shorter end. If you are interested in unique dystopian societies, this book is definitely worth reading! 

### The Good
- Very well written characters with emotional depth 
- Presents deep philosophical questions about human identity, determinism/free will, and ethics 
### The Bad
- Constant disconnected flashbacks. The book follows Kathy's out of order recollection of events and was a little disorienting. This style is used throughout the entire book and feels tired after a while of reading it. That being said it does end up tying together well if you push through it. 
- Em dashes (this is nitpicky). Ishiguro regularly uses em dashes to interrupt Kathy's train of thought. For whatever reason this annoyed me to no end and almost made me put the book down a couple of times.

I think this story is best told as it unfolds throughout the book so I wouldn't seek out much more information before reading! 

## After You Read (Spoilers)

### Short Synopsis
_Never Let Me Go_ chronicles the experience of Kathy H. attending a boarding school called Hailsham through her eyes. Along with her close friends Ruth and Tommy, she navigates the complexities of adolescence while slowly uncovering the haunting truth about their purpose in society. As they transition into adulthood, the trio must confront the reality that they are clones raised specifically to serve as organ donors.

### Thoughts
The book did a great job of creating a believable dystopian society. But I think it gave too much away too early, I could already see where the book was going before I was even 20% through. The hints throughout the book made the reveal feel like a "finally" moment for me rather than a "woah" moment. But I think the biggest miss for me was once this amazing world was built, the characters did next to nothing to interpret, understand, or respond to it. The way the book was structured made it feel like it was built for a shock reveal but when that fell flat it felt as though the purpose should've been introducing philosophical questions about their condition which I don't think the book did well.

I've seen reviews complaining that Tommy and Kathy should've rebelled and while I understand the sentiment, upon further reflection I don't think this necessarily must be true. Being raised into these conditions leads to a sort of complacency: accepting that this is the reality of your existence. But given their level of education I do think that they should've questioned their circumstances more than they did. Not only did they not rebel, but they didn't even think of it besides trying to get deferment. 

The characters were pretty painful, I don't think I know anyone who overthinks as much as Kathy. From calculating the number of people who can overhear you to the ridiculous effort to divise plans to emotionally manipulate/interpret other characters. And her narrative presents it in such a way that makes it seem that all the students are like this (I wonder to what extent this is actually true). I don't understand why this was necessary or what value it brought the book. But in some sense it does make sense the way she recalls stories the entire book and feels like adding additional information that seems extracurricular at times. Also Ruth is such an insanely insufferable character and I don't understand why Kathy went along with her for as long as she did.

### Questions
- Can you expect people raised under poor conditions to rebel even if this is all they've known? Or do they become complacent?
- What does it mean to be human?
- Is rebelling an aspect of human nature? If not, what circumstances lead to the desire of rebelling? If so, does it make you less human to not want to rebel?
- How morally flexible can you be for the sake of medicine?
