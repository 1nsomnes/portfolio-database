# Never Let Me Go Book Review 

**Completed:** 01/01/2026

**Rating:** 3/5 

## Before You Read (No Spoilers)

Kazuo Ishiguro's _Never Let Me Go_ is a dystopinian sci-fi novel following Kathy B. who looks back on her days at the secluded Hailsham boarding school. The narrative captures a sense of quiet tragedy—the feeling of a childhood that was idyllic on the surface but underscored by a growing unease about the future. 

Despite _Never Let Me Go's_ critical acclaim I don't think it is an absolute must read. That being said, you will not regret reading this book, especially considering it's on the shorter end. 

### The Good
- Very well written characters with emotional depth 
- Presents deep philosophical questions about human identity, determinism/free will, and ethics 
### The Bad
- Constant disconnected flashbacks. The book follows Kathy's recollection of events which came chronologically out of order and was a little disorienting. This style is used throughout the entire book and feels tired after a while of reading it. That being said it does end up tying together well if you push through it. 
- Em dashes (this is nitpicky). Ishiguro regularly uses em dashes to interrupt Kathy's train of thought. For whatever reason this annoyed me to no end and almost made me put the book down a couple of times.

I think this story is best told as it unfolds throughout the book so I wouldn't seek out much more information before reading!
